---

## Overview

JobFlow-AI is a minimal viable product (MVP) designed to simplify and accelerate the job application process. It targets users such as international MBA grads, career pivoters, and domestic graduate students who face repetitive, time-consuming tasks when tailoring resumes and cover letters for multiple job postings.  

The MVP focuses on the **core loop**:
1. Log in and see relevant job postings.  
2. Set a daily application goal.  
3. Use AI to generate ATS-friendly, tailored resumes and cover letters.  
4. Submit applications with one click.  
5. Track progress on a dashboard with analytics.

This approach reduces admin work, boosts confidence, and makes applying to 20–50 jobs/day feasible.
